# 🎯 Random Number Generator Tool – Task 03

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my **Software Development Internship at SkillCraft Technology**.  
I built a **Random Number Generator Tool** using **C++**, which allows users to generate a random number within a given range.  
It was a great opportunity to strengthen my **logic-building skills**, explore **randomness in programming**, and improve **input handling**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Generates random numbers within a **user-defined range**
- ✅ **Validates user input** to ensure the minimum is less than or equal to the maximum
- ✅ Uses **`<cstdlib>` and `<ctime>`** for randomness
- ✅ Clean, efficient, and **beginner-friendly** code

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Libraries Used:** `<iostream>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`

---

## 📂 How It Works
1. User enters the **minimum** and **maximum** range values.
2. Program checks for **valid input** (minimum ≤ maximum).
3. A **random seed** is initialized using the current time.
4. A random number within the given range is generated and displayed.

## 🖥️ Example Output
Enter the minimum value: 10
Enter the maximum value: 50
Random Number: 37
